# arvis-prettier

Run Prettier in Arvis. Press Enter to copy the output to your clipboard.

Optionally, you can also get the Flow types stripped out. This is handy for running something quickly in a normal JS environment.

ðŸ†• There's a third option to get the Flow types commented out. Flow actually supports a comment-based syntax. See the usage [here](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/comments/).
